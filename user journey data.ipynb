    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project is centered on analyzing the pre-purchase behavior of users to understand their journey across the company's front-end web pages. By examining interactions from various sessions leading to a purchase, the project aims to provide insights into how users navigate the platform before making their first subscription purchase. The extracted user journey data will serve as a key resource for marketing teams to improve customer experience and optimize conversion rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project utilizes a dataset that includes three main tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "student_purchases: Contains records of user payments and purchase types.\n",
    "front_visitors: Links visitors with their user IDs.\n",
    "front_interactions: Logs visitor activities, including page visits, clicks, and other interactions."

    "The key objectives of this project are:\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify users who made their first subscription purchase between January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "To extract the sequence of web pages visited by each user before their first purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "To group all visited pages into a user journey string for each session.\n",
    "\n",
    "To filter out test users (who paid $0 for their subscriptions).\n",
    "\n",
    "To replace raw URLs with readable aliases for better clarity."

    "front_visitors: Maps visitor_id to user_id. Users who never made a purchase have no associated user_id and are excluded.\n",

    "## Analysis Approach\n",
    "The project follows a structured approach using SQL queries to extract the desired user journey data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Filter Subscription Data\n",
    "Identify users who made their first subscription purchase between January 1, 2023, and March 31, 2023.\n",
    "Exclude test users by filtering out those with a purchase price of $0.\n",
    "Classify the subscription types as 'monthly', 'quarterly', or 'annual'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Join Interaction Data\n",
    "Using the user_id from the filtered purchase data, join the interaction data to extract all web events for these users before their first purchase date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Create URL Aliases\n",
    "Use the provided URL aliases to simplify event source and destination URLs.\n",
    "Replace long URLs with human-readable names, such as \"Homepage\", \"Login\", \"Sign up\", \"Courses\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Concatenate User Journeys\n",
    "Combine the source and destination URLs of each user interaction within a session into a single string.\n",
    "Use the GROUP_CONCAT function to concatenate all interactions in a session into one journey string, separating each page visit with a hyphen (-).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Output User Journeys\n",
    "Generate a final output containing the following columns: user_id, session_id, subscription_type, and user_journey.\n",
    "The user_journey column contains the ordered sequence of pages visited by the user before making their first purchase."

This data provides valuable insights into user behavior before converting to paying customers.\n",
